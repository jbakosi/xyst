  \page      lohcg_example_sphere_quarter LohCG: Inviscid flow past a sphere

This example uses @ref inciter_lohcg in @ref inciter_main to compute the
inviscid constant-density (incompressible) flow past a sphere. Since the
analytic solution of this problem is known from potential flow theory, we can
use it to verify the correctness of the software implementation of the method.

@section lohcg_example_sphere_quarter_setup Problem setup

Due to the spatial symmetry of the problem, only quarter of the sphere is
represented. The computational mesh consists of 73,397 tetrahedra connecting
14,281 points, whose surface mesh is depicted below. The initial conditions
prescribe the free-stream velocity of \f$\mbox{\boldmath$v$}=(1,0,0)\f$. As
boundary conditions, the pressure is set to zero at the outflow and the
velocity is set to \f$\mbox{\boldmath$v$}=(1,0,0)\f$ at the inflow. Symmetry
(free-slip) conditions are applied on the sphere, the symmetry and farfield
surfaces.
