This example uses @ref inciter_riecg in @ref inciter_main to compute a
solid-body rotation problem. Such tests are frequently used to evaluate and
compare numerical schemes for convection-dominated problems.

Here we evaluate the numerical method using Zalesak's slotted cylinder problem
[1], augmented by Leveque [2] in order to examine the resolution of both smooth
and discontinuous profiles.

@section riecg_example_slotcyl_equations Equations solved

In this example we numerically solve the linear advection equation coupled to
the Euler equations, see also @ref inciter_riecg. as

\f[ \begin{split}
  \frac{\partial U}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_j} = S,\qquad
  U = \begin{Bmatrix} \rho \\ \rho u_i \\ \rho E \\ c  \end{Bmatrix}, \enskip F_j =
  \begin{Bmatrix} \rho u_j \\ \rho u_iu_j + p\delta_{ij} \\ u_j(\rho E + p) \\ u_j c
  \end{Bmatrix}, \enskip
  S = \begin{Bmatrix} S_\rho \\ S_{u,i} \\ S_E \\ S_c \end{Bmatrix},
\end{split} \f]
where the summation convention on repeated indices has been applied,
\f$\color[HTML]{dcdcdc}\rho\f$ is the density, \f$\color[HTML]{dcdcdc}u_i\f$ is
the velocity vector, \f$\color[HTML]{dcdcdc}E=u_iu_i/2+e\f$ is the specific
total energy, \f$\color[HTML]{dcdcdc}e\f$ is the specific internal energy, and
\f$\color[HTML]{dcdcdc}p\f$ is the pressure. \f$\color[HTML]{dcdcdc}S_\rho\f$,
\f$\color[HTML]{dcdcdc}S_{u,i}\f$, \f$\color[HTML]{dcdcdc}S_E\f$, and
\f$\color[HTML]{dcdcdc}S_c\f$ are source terms that arise from the application
of the method of manufactured solutions, used for verification only; these
source terms are zero when computing practical engineering problems. The system
is closed with the ideal gas law equation of state
\f[ \begin{split}
  p = \rho e (\gamma - 1),
\end{split} \f]
where \f$\color[HTML]{dcdcdc}\gamma\f$ is the ratio of specific heats.

@note While here we are only interested in the solution of the scalar field and
that could also be done by prescribing an external velocity field and solving
only for c, we still solve the above coupled system. This way we test the
solver as it is intended to be used in practice: solving the same system of
equations with its software implementation.

@section riecg_example_slotcyl_setup Problem setup

The inital configuration for the scalar field, c, is depicted in the figure
below.
@m_div{m-col-m-10 m-center-m}
<img src="images/slotcyl_ic.png"/>
@m_enddiv

While this is a 2D test problem, we calculate it on a 3D domain with the
extents {0,1,0} x {0,1,0.05}, Since we are only interested in the evolution of
the scalar, we prescribe the source terms that yield a stationary flow with a
prescribed rotational velocity field ui = { 1/2 - y, x - 1/2, 0 } as
\f[ \begin{split}
S_\rho &= 0 \\
S_{u,i}&= \left\{ -\rho u_2, \rho u_1, 0 \right\} \\
S_E    &= u_iS_{u,i} = 0 \\
S_c    &= 0
\end{split} \f]
Each solid body lies within a radius r0 = 0.15 centered at a point {x0,y0,0}.
In the rest of the domain the solution is initially zero. The shapes of the
three bodies can be expressed in terms of the normalized distance function for
the respective reference point {x0,y0,0}
\f[ \begin{split}
r(x,y)=\frac{1}{r_0}\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2}.
\end{split} \f]
The center of the slotted cylinder is located at {x0,y0,0} = {0.5,0.75,0} and
its geometry is given by
\f[ \begin{split}
c(x,y)=\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&0.6\enskip\mathrm{if}\enskip|x-x_0|\ge0.025\enskip\mathrm{or}\enskip y\ge0.85,\\&0\enskip\mathrm{otherwise.}
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{split} \f]
The corresponding analytical expression for the conical body is
\f[ \begin{split}
c(x,y)=0.6[1-r(x,y)],\quad(x_0,y_0)=(0.5,0.25),
\end{split} \f]
while the shape and location of the hump reads
\f[ \begin{split}
c(x,y)=0.2\left[1+\cos{\left(\pi\min\left(r(x,y),1\right)\right)}\right],\quad(x_0,y_0)=(0.25,0.5).
\end{split} \f]

The initial conditions are sampled from the analytic solutions above. We set
inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for the flow variables on all sides
of the domain, sampling their analytic solutions. For the scalar, homogeneous
Dirichlet conditions are set on those sides with normals in the x and y
directions.

First, we verify that the flow variables are indeed constant in time. This
verifies that that correct source terms have been chosen and that they have
been implemented correctly. The following figure depicts the time evolution of
L2-norm of the conserved flow variables.
