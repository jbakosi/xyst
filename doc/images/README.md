# How to generate logos

## ASCII art logos of executable names

The ASCII art logos of the _executable_ names, have been generated at
http://patorjk.com/software/taag using the default settings:

   - Font: _Graffiti_
   - Character width: _default_
   - Character height: _default_

## ASCII art logos in SVG format

The ASCII art logos in SVG format, to display them on HTML pages, have been
generated by [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), using doc/txt2pdf,
yielding a PDF which then was converted to SVG using
[pdf2svg](http://www.cityinthesky.co.uk/opensource/pdf2svg/) as

       cd doc/txt2pdf/
       make pdf
       pdf2svg txt2pdf.pdf <executable>.svg
