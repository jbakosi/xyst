_Xyst_ is a Navier-Stokes solver for engineering flows.

The goal of this project is to simulate engineering problems with a
production-quality code that is extensible and maintainable, using hardware
resources efficiently, even for problems with unpredictable, heterogeneous,
and dynamic compute-load distribution.

The software implementation facilitates the effective use of hardware of any
size, from laptops to the largest distributed-memory clusters, by combining
data-, and task-parallelism on top of the [Charm++](http://charmplusplus.org)
runtime system. Charm++'s execution model is asynchronous by default, allowing
arbitrary overlap of computation and communication. Built-in automatic load
balancing enables redistribution of heterogeneous computational load based on
real-time CPU load measurement at negligible cost. The runtime system also
features automatic checkpointing, fault tolerance, resilience against hardware
failure, and supports power-, and energy-aware computation.

@section mainpage_tools Tools

Xyst consists of the following tools:

@ref inciter_main --- __Navier-Stokes solver for engineering flows__ \n
Implements multiple flow solvers for complex engineering geometries.

@ref meshconv_main --- __Tetrahedron-mesh converter__ \n
Converts large tetrahedron meshes between various formats.

@ref unittest_main --- __Test suite for synchronous and asynchronous
functions__ \n
Tests serial, and synchronous and asynchronous concurrent functions.

@section mainpage_build Build

Install prerequisites: _Debian-based linux_

@code
apt install git cmake g++ ninja-build libopenmpi-dev libnetcdf-mpi-dev
@endcode

Clone, build, test

@code
git clone https://codeberg.org/xyst/xyst.git && cd xyst

All executables will be under `build/Main/`.

@section mainpage_license License

[GPL v3](https://codeberg.org/xyst/xyst/src/branch/master/LICENSE).

@section mainpage_history History

Xyst is forked from [Quinoa](https://quinoacomputing.github.io/archive).
Compared to Quinoa, Xyst

1. Removes the stochastic differential equation solver
([walker](https://wlkr.cc)),

2. Implements different solvers,

3. Uses [Lua](https://www.lua.org) for input files, and

4. Simplifies Quinoa's code and its build system.

Development on [Quinoa](https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa) and
[Xyst](https://codeberg.org/xyst/xyst) continues on different forks.
