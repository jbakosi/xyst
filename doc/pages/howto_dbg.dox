@section howto_dbg_build How to build Xyst in debug mode

The default build type is release, which enables optimized code detecting the
CPU type. To clone and build in debug mode do

@code
git clone https://codeberg.org/xyst/xyst.git && cd xyst
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../src
make
@endcode

@warning Performance will be significantly lower compared to release mode due
to extra checks to find programmer errors.
