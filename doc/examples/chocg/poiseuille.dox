  \page      chocg_example_poiseuille ChoCG: Poiseuille flow

This example uses @ref inciter_chocg in @ref inciter_main to compute the
stationary viscous constant-density (incompressible) laminar flow field in a
channel due to an imposed pressure gradient. Since the analytic solution is
known the objective is to establish and verify the accuracy of the numerical
method and the correctness of the software implementation.

@section chocg_example_poiseuille_setup Problem setup

The problem domain consists of a rectangular channel with an imposed streamwise
pressure gradient. While the flow field is nominally 2D, we compute it in 3D.
The length of the channel in the X coordinate direction is 20 units, its height
in Y is \f$L_y=1\f$, and the width in Z is adjusted to contain a single element
in the Z direction depending on the mesh resolution.

An example mesh is displayed below. The initial and boundary conditions
prescribe a pressure gradient of \f$\text{d}p/\text{d}x=-0.12\f$, thus the
analytic solution for the streamwise velocity is
\f[
v_x = \frac{1}{2\mu}\left(-\frac{\text{d}p}{\text{d}x}\right)y\left(L_y-y\right)
\f]
where \f$p\f$ is the pressure and \f$\mu=0.01\f$ is the dynamic viscosity which
yields the laminar Reynolds number as \f$ \text{Re} = \rho \overline{v}_x L_y /
\mu = 100 \f$, defined based on the fluid density \f$\rho=1\f$ and the average
streamwise velocity \f$ \overline{v}_x = 1 \f$. The flow starts with quiescent
initial conditions: \f$\mbox{\boldmath$v$}(\mbox{\boldmath$x$},t=0)=(0,0,0)\f$.
At the Z extremes of the computational domain Dirichlet boundary conditions are
set to \f$v_y=v_z=0\f$ and no-slip/no-penetration boundary conditions,
\f$v_x=v_y=v_z=0\f$, are applied at the Y extremes representing the channel
walls.

@section chocg_example_poiseuille_errors Numerical solutions and errors

To estimate the order of convergence, the numerical solution is computed using
three different meshes, whose properties of are tabulated below.
       Mesh     | Points    | Tetrahedra   | h
       :------: | --------: | -----------: | --------:
              1 |     1,212 |      3,000   | 0.25
              2 |     4,422 |     12,000   | 0.16
              3 |    16,842 |     48,000   | 0.08
Here h is the average edge length.

Plotted below are the computed streamwise velocity profiles sampled in the
middle of the domain along a line in the Y direction using three different
meshes, obtained after the solution has converged to a stationary state.

The L1 and L2 errors are computed as
\f[ \begin{split}
\left| \left| \varepsilon \right| \right|_1 & = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n V^i \left|
\hat{v}_x^i - v_x^i \right|} {\sum_{i=1}^n V^i} \\
\left| \left| \varepsilon \right| \right|_2 & = \left[\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n V^i
\left( \hat{v}_x^i - v_x^i \right)^2} {\sum_{i=1}^n V^i}\right]^{1/2}
\end{split} \f]
where \f$n\f$ is the number of points sampled across the channel,
\f$\hat{v}_x^i\f$ and \f$v_x^i\f$ are the exact and computed solutions at mesh
point \f$i\f$, and \f$V^i\f$ denotes the volume associated to mesh point
\f$i\f$.

The tables below display the numerical errors for two different types of
damping for the advection term. The order of convergence is estimated using the
two finer meshes as
\f[
p = \frac{ \log \left| \left| \varepsilon \right| \right|^{m+1} - \log \left|
\left| \varepsilon \right| \right|^m}{ \log h^{m+1} - \log h^m}
\f]
where \f$m\f$ is a mesh index.

convergence rates using second-order damping for advection and forward Euler
time stepping.
