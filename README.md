_Xyst_ is a Navier-Stokes solver for engineering flows.

Our ultimate goal is to simulate engineering problems with a production-quality
code that is extensible and maintainable, using hardware resources efficiently,
even for problems with a priori unknown, heterogeneous, and dynamic load
distribution. More details at [xyst.cc](https://xyst.cc).
